**render-jinja** is a little Python script that renders a Jinja template, with the attributes given as arguments.

I use it in the build process of my various projects: [Libarray](https://gitorious.org/mcinglis/libarray), [Libmaybe](https://gitorious.org/mcinglis/libmaybe), etc.

render-jinja is available at [Gitorious](https://gitorious.org/mcinglis/render-jinja), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/mcinglis/render-jinja), and [GitHub](https://github.com/mcinglis/render-jinja).
